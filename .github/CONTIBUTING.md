# Contributing

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome 
contributions from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the 
smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to bridge-ui, please fork, fix, commit and send a 
pull request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. If
you wish to submit more complex changes though, please check up with the core 
devs first on [issues](https://github.com/hermeznetwork/bridge-ui/issues) to 
ensure those changes are in line with the general philosophy of the project 
and/or get some early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter as
well as our review and merge procedures quick and simple.
